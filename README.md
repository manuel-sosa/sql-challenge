This repo contains the 1) ERD sketch, 2) table schemata, 3) and query analyses for Pewlett Hackard's employee database, between 1980s and 1990s. The database has been sourced from six CSV files and is now ready for analysis.

Six tables constitute the database schema, holding data ranging from employee details to salary records. The schema creation scripts include primary keys, foreign keys, and not-null constraints.

:heavy_check_mark: # **Query Analyses:** [(_Query Analyses_)](https://github.com/manuel-sosa/sql-challenge/blob/main/03_data_analysis/employee_queries.sql)

The repo includes a series of SQL queries that address specific analytical questions, such as listing employees by department and counting last name frequency across the employee base.
